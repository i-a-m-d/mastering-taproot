# Mastering Taproot (Public Draft)

### About the Book

*Mastering Taproot* is a developer-focused, reproducible guide to Bitcoin’s most powerful upgrade — Taproot.

This manuscript emphasizes:

- full code samples
- real testnet transactions
- precise stack execution
- minimal abstractions

The goal is not to “explain concepts”, but to **engineer them** — from single-leaf script spends, to multi-path Merkle tree constructions, to privacy-preserving control blocks.

Foundational Bitcoin engineering knowledge should be reproducible, inspectable, and forkable — therefore this work is published open-access.

This project values *precision and reproducibility* above abstraction or opinions.
